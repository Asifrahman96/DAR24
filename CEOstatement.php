                                Dear Shareholders,                            
                            </p>
                            <p>As we reflect on a year of progress and
                            achievement, I am proud of the resilience,
                            innovation, and purpose-driven growth
                            demonstrated by Kuwait Telecommunications
                            Company (stc). The strength of our operational
                            and financial performance stands as a
                            testament to our steadfast dedication
                            to fostering innovation and operational
                            excellence.</p>
                            <p>Throughout the year, we were able to
                            successfully navigate a volatile landscape,
                            seizing opportunities and overcoming
                            challenges to reinforce our leadership.
                            Our achievements reflect a clear focus on
                            advancing our strategic objectives, expanding
                            5G infrastructure, enhancing the customer
                            experience, and driving digital transformation
                            – each of which strengthens our position amid
                            the rapidly evolving global telecommunications
                            and ICT sectors.</p>
                            <p>In line with CITRA’s recent regulatory guidance,
                            we took decisive steps to accelerate the rollout
                            of 5G-Advanced (5.5G), setting the stage for
                            next-generation connectivity that delivers
                            faster speeds, lower latency, and seamless
                            integration of AI, machine learning, and other
                            emerging technologies. This deployment
                            also enhances energy efficiency and extends
                            our reach to better serve indoor and rural
                            areas, while boosting network security and
                            enhancing Massive MIMO technology and
                            extended frequency bands. The launch of
                            5.5G represents a critical step toward future
                            innovations in wireless communication,
                            positioning stc to meet the demands of
                            new industries and the global connectivity
                            landscape. By empowering industries and
                            users alike with next-generation experiences,
                            we drive technological and economic growth
                            alongside sustainable connectivity.</p>
                            <p>Aligned with our digital transformation
                            strategy, we have also made customercentricity
                            a priority, enhancing service
                            offerings and expanding our digital platforms
                            for a more intuitive, personalized engagement.
                            Over the past few years, stc has focused on
                            delivering integrated technical and corporate
                            database solutions to strengthen our
                            competitive position and diversify revenue
                            streams. To that end, we have streamlined
                            processes, improved customer support, and
                            made significant investments in data security,
                            ensuring consistent connectivity and reliability
                            for our valued customers and shareholders.</p>
